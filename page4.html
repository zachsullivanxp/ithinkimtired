        being an artist and creative to me is a privilege but also the only way.
      </p>

      <p class="textanimation12">
        i am grateful to be able to choose this path, but i also know that there
        is nothing else i can do.

        I think you’re at a point of burnout when you make things for the sake
        of feeling “productive”
      </p>
      <p class="textanimation16">
        but in reality it’s like throwing up a bunch of shit that doesn’t
        matter.

      <p class="textanimation19">
        I let myself sink in it and almost relish in the exhaustion because you
        can't avoid it.
      </p>
      <p class="textanimation20">
        It's better to face it than try to cope because it will further exhaust
        you.

    <div class="paragraph-typingyellow4">
      <p class="textanimation22">
        I just am in that mentality that I got myself into it and have no one
        else to blame but me,
      </p>
      <p class="textanimation23">
        so me doing this and “taking a break” is being selfish and only harming
        everyone around me.

        when I started making art, it was a therapeutic way to express my
        feelings.
      </p>
      <p class="textanimation14">
        I used to be enthusiastic about it, but it's become actual work and not
        just a bunch of passion projects

        Burnout is similar to the smoke from burning out the candle before you
        sleep. It is a spark that dies and
      </p>
      <p class="textanimation18">
        almost fades, but you still have the ghost of it lingering.

        I don’t know when to quit. Even though I’m miserable, I stick through it
        because I feel that responsibility.

        I am drowning. It is the home stretch of the school year. Finals and me
        having to go back across the country

      <p class="textanimation25">
        is worrisome. I'm getting through it, barely, but I'll make it out
        alive.
