        This is a project on creative burnout—sometimes passion can be
        stressful. Especially in a university setting like USC, sometimes I feel
        guilty for complaining about my<br><br>workload when I have friends double
        majoring in chemistry and physics, or doing economics and data sciences.
        But I think it's important to stop and realize that<br><br>being burned out
        creatively is a very real thing. As artists we put so much of ourselves
        into our work, pouring every emotion, thought, and feeling into
        something<br><br>that is intimately ours. In the week since I've started this
        project, glitch.me says I've spent 24 hours on it—which I'm sure is
        peanuts compared to my peers.<br><br><br>Art is wonderful, art is hard.<br>
